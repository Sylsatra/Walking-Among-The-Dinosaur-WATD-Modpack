# Walking Among The Dinosaur Modpack (Forge 1.18.2)

## Introduction  
**Walking Among The Dinosaur** is a prehistoric survival modpack that thrusts you into a world teeming with ancient life. You’ll experience an *epic journey of survival in a wild and untamed world* – and here’s the twist: **you won’t be alone**. *You’ll be walking among the dinosaurs!* ([Man vs Wild (Walking among the dinosaurs) - Modpack - Modpack Index](https://www.modpackindex.com/modpack/75154/man-vs-wild-walking-among-the-dinosaurs#:~:text=Welcome%20to%20a%20prehistoric%20adventure,be%20walking%20among%20the%20dinosaurs)) This modpack emphasizes realistic survival mechanics and immersive dinosaur interactions, creating a challenging and atmospheric adventure.

**Key Features:**  
- **Prehistoric World:** Explore a land where dinosaurs and other ancient creatures roam free. There are **no modern villages or typical Minecraft structures** – you are truly in an untamed prehistoric era (even standard mobs and villagers are absent to preserve the wild atmosphere ([Man vs Wild (Walking among the dinosaurs) - Minecraft Modpacks - CurseForge](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/modpacks/man-vs-wild-walking-among-the-dinosaurs#:~:text=,it%20smoothly%20with%20Sildur%20Shader))).  
- **Realistic Survival Mechanics:** Manage additional survival needs like **thirst and body temperature**, along with a new **stamina system**. The environment itself is a threat – you’ll need to stay hydrated, avoid extreme temperatures, and rest appropriately. These systems add *“real-life realism merged into Minecraft”* ([Man vs Wild (Walking among the dinosaurs) - Minecraft Modpacks - CurseForge](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/modpacks/man-vs-wild-walking-among-the-dinosaurs#:~:text=,realistic%20sleep%20mechanics)), making every decision critical.  
- **Overhauled Health System:** The modpack uses a **locational health** mechanic. Instead of one health bar, your body has individual parts that can be injured. For example, taking damage to your **head or torso can be deadly (if either drops to zero, you die) and limb injuries cause debuffs** (broken legs slow you down, arm injuries weaken your attacks, etc.) ([First Aid - Minecraft Mods - CurseForge](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/first-aid#:~:text=You%20will%20die%20as%20soon,can%20be%20supressed%20by%20morphine)). Healing requires bandages and time, so prioritizing protection (like wearing a helmet to guard your head) is vital.  
- **Dinosaur Behavior & Interaction:** The dinosaurs aren’t just scenery – they behave dynamically. Some are docile unless provoked, while others are apex predators that will hunt you. You can encounter everything from towering herbivores grazing peacefully to packs of velociraptors stalking their prey. With effort, you might even **hatch or tame certain prehistoric creatures**, learning to coexist with them.  
- **Primitive Progression:** Say goodbye to punching trees and instant wooden tools. You’ll start from scratch with **flint tools and basic resources**, mimicking a true stone-age experience. Early-game progression has been redesigned to be more realistic (for example, you must knapp flint to make blades, craft a flint hatchet to cut wood, etc.). Basic wooden and stone tools from vanilla are not craftable – you’ll use primitive equivalents until you advance ([HardRock Tools & Materials - Minecraft Mods - CurseForge](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/hardrock-tools-materials#:~:text=It%20was%20unrealistic%20for%20me,vanilla%20wooden%20and%20stone%20tools)).  
- **Environmental Challenges:** Stamina and physics play a role in your journey. Sprinting everywhere will exhaust you, especially when carrying heavy gear. Temperature extremes can be deadly if you’re unprepared – blazing deserts and freezing taigas require appropriate clothing or shelter. The world features dynamic elements like **falling trees** and environmental weathering, so be mindful of your surroundings. There’s no “punching dirt and building a palace on day one” here – survival comes first.  
- **Immersive Worldbuilding:** A rich sense of lore underpins the experience (see **Lore & Worldbuilding** below). From the moment you awake in this primeval world, the atmosphere, custom advancements, and in-game cues will guide your imagination about **why** you’re here and how humanity (that’s you!) fits into the Jurassic picture.

With these features, *Walking Among The Dinosaur* offers a truly unique survival experience – blending the thrill of **exploration and discovery** with the tension of **man vs. nature** on an epic scale ([Man vs Wild (Walking among the dinosaurs) - Minecraft Modpacks - CurseForge](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/modpacks/man-vs-wild-walking-among-the-dinosaurs#:~:text=Embark%20on%20the%20ultimate%20adventure,of%20conquering%20an%20extraordinary%20world)). Prepare to step back in time and face the ultimate challenge of survival!

## Installation Instructions  

You can install the modpack either manually (using the Forge launcher or a Minecraft launcher of your choice) or via the convenient Modrinth App. Before starting, ensure you have **Minecraft 1.18.2** installed and **Java 17** configured (Minecraft 1.18 requires Java 17). It’s also recommended to allocate **at least 6-8 GB of RAM** to Minecraft due to the large number of mods and the world generation complexity.

**Option 1: Manual Installation (Forge)**  
1. **Install Forge 1.18.2:** Download the **Forge 1.18.2** installer from the official Forge site and run it. This will create a Forge profile in your Minecraft launcher. Make sure to launch Minecraft with the Forge 1.18.2 profile at least once to generate the needed folders.  
2. **Download the Modpack:** Obtain the `WalkingAmongTheDinosaur-1.18.2.zip` modpack file (or `.mrpack` file) from the official source. If the pack is hosted on Modrinth or GitHub, download the release corresponding to this modpack.  
3. **Add Mods to Minecraft:** If you have a `.mrpack` (Modrinth pack format), you can import it directly in many launchers (like Prism Launcher or MultiMC) by selecting “Import from ZIP/Modrinth”. This will automatically install all mods and config files. Alternatively, if you have a zip with a **manifest** or **mods folder**: 
   - Open your Minecraft directory (`.minecraft` for the default launcher, or the instance folder for MultiMC/CurseForge launcher).  
   - Copy the contents of the modpack’s `mods` folder into your Minecraft `mods` folder. Also copy any config, `kubejs`, or `resourcepacks` folders from the pack into the corresponding locations (these contain important tweaks and assets).  
4. **Run Minecraft:** Start the Minecraft launcher with the Forge 1.18.2 profile. Select the **Walking Among The Dinosaur** modpack instance if you created one. Launch the game. The first load may be slow as it sets up config files.  
5. **Confirm Installation:** Once at the main menu, you should see the modpack’s name or a custom title screen. You can also go to Mods and verify a long list of mods (dinosaurs, survival mods, etc.) are present. If everything looks good, you’re ready to play!

**Option 2: Modrinth App Installation**  
1. **Install the Modrinth App:** If you don’t have it, download the Modrinth App from the [Modrinth website](https://modrinth.com) and install it. This app streamlines modpack installation.  
2. **Search for the Modpack:** Open the Modrinth App and use the search bar to find "**Walking Among The Dinosaur**". You should see the modpack in the search results (make sure the version is Forge 1.18.2).  
3. **Install with One Click:** Click the **Install** button on the modpack’s page. The app will automatically download all required mods, Forge, and set up an instance for you.  
4. **Launch the Game:** In the Modrinth App, go to your **instances** or **packs**, find *Walking Among The Dinosaur*, and hit Play. This will launch Minecraft with everything configured.  
5. **(Optional) Updates:** The Modrinth App will also notify you of modpack updates. You can update to the latest version of the pack easily through the app when a new release is available.

**Dependencies & Configuration:**  
- No additional mods are required beyond the pack contents. However, **enable the bundled resource packs** if prompted on first load (some modpacks include custom resource packs for the best experience).  
- **Optimize Settings:** Given the world generation mods, it’s recommended to pre-generate or use the included performance mods. The pack is already optimized with performance mods (like Oculus, etc.), but you can lower settings if needed. Ensure that if using shaders with Oculus, you disable “Smart Animations” (if OptiFine is present) as noted by the modpack author ([Man vs Wild (Walking among the dinosaurs) - Minecraft Modpacks - CurseForge](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/modpacks/man-vs-wild-walking-among-the-dinosaurs#:~:text=%2A%20Self,is%20disabled%20when%20using%20Optifine)).  
- **Server Setup:** To set up a server, install Forge 1.18.2 on the server and copy the modpack’s mods & config folders to the server directory. **Remove any client-only mods** (such as voice chat or map UI mods) as needed. More detailed server instructions might be provided in a `SERVER_README.txt` if included.

After installation, you’re all set. Launch the game and dive into the prehistoric world!

## Gameplay Guide  

### Getting Started – Early Game Survival  
When you first spawn into the world, you’ll quickly notice this isn’t vanilla Minecraft. **Punching trees** yields nothing, and you’re surrounded by strange ferns, tall grasses, and distant dinosaur calls. Your first objective is to secure basic tools and shelter **without** the luxury of normal wood tools.

**1. Stone Age Tools (Flint Knapping):** Look for **gravel** on riverbanks or cave entrances and break it to get flint. In this modpack, flint is your best friend at the start. Find a hard surface (exposed stone) and **right-click or use flint on the stone to knapp it into flint shards** ([No Tree Punching - Minecraft Mods - CurseForge](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/no-tree-punching#:~:text=,and%20build%20a%20crafting%20table)). With flint shards in hand, break some tall grass or ferns – they will drop **plant fibers**. Craft plant fibers into plant string (3 fibers) or use the fibers directly. Now craft a **Flint Knife** (typically 1 flint shard + 1 stick, shapeless) ([No Tree Punching - Minecraft Mods - CurseForge](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/no-tree-punching#:~:text=,and%20build%20a%20crafting%20table)). Use this knife to **harvest more plant fibers** from grass much faster, and craft those into **Plant String** (a primitive string). With plant string, a flint shard, and a stick, you can craft a **Flint Hatchet** (the exact recipe is one flint shard, one plant string, and one stick in a diagonal pattern ([No Tree Punching - RLCraft Wiki](https://rlcraft.fandom.com/wiki/No_Tree_Punching#:~:text=a%20method%20of%20gaining%20wood,Plant%20String%20and%201x%20Stick))). This hatchet is crucial – it’s slow and not very durable, but it allows you to **cut down your first tree**. Sticks can be obtained by breaking leaves or picking up fallen branches (you may find sticks on the ground or get them from leaf decay).  

**2. Getting Wood & Crafting Table:** Using the Flint Hatchet, chop a tree. (Be cautious – if Dynamic Trees is in the pack, chopping the base of a tree will cause the whole tree to fall!). Collect logs. Now you can make a crafting table: craft wooden planks from logs as usual (the hatchet allows you to hew planks). If the recipe for planks is altered, try crafting logs + your hatchet in the 2x2 grid to get planks. Place your **Crafting Table** – this is a major milestone (there may even be an advancement for it). With a crafting table, you can craft a **Stone Hammer** using stone and sticks (instead of a pickaxe). The HardRock tools mod replaces the normal pickaxe: you’ll need a stone hammer (two stones and a stick, for example) to mine stone effectively ([HardRock Tools & Materials - Minecraft Mods - CurseForge](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/hardrock-tools-materials#:~:text=It%20was%20unrealistic%20for%20me,vanilla%20wooden%20and%20stone%20tools)). The stone hammer can break rocks and ores but cannot mine as deep or fast as a pickaxe; iron or bronze tools will come later.

**3. Shelter and Fire:** As evening approaches, you’ll want shelter. Use your hatchet or hammer to dig into a hillside or pile up some logs as makeshift walls. The world gets dangerous at night – not only might predators become more active, but it also gets colder. **Temperature** is a factor now. If you’re in a cold biome, nightfall can bring freezing temperatures that inflict hypothermia. Craft a **campfire** (usually 3 sticks, 1 flint, 1 log or use a vanilla recipe if enabled) and light it for warmth and light. Campfires will also allow you to **purify water and cook basic food**. (Torches in this pack might be **unlit torches** initially – requiring lighting with a match or fire source – check if the Realistic Torches mod is included).

**4. Thirst and Water:** You’ll notice a **thirst bar** (water droplets icon) on your HUD. Just like hunger, it will drop as time passes (faster if you sprint or if you’re in hot biomes). You **cannot drink directly from oceans or rivers safely** – doing so might make you sick with thirst or poison effects. Water has different purity levels in this modpack. If you drink **unclean water**, there’s a chance you’ll get sick or poisoned ([Thirst Was Taken - Minecraft Mod](https://modrinth.com/mod/thirst-was-taken#:~:text=If%20you%20drink%20non,get%20sick%2C%20or%20worse%2C%20poisoned)). Early on, craft a **water pouch** or simply use glass bottles: fill a bottle from a river, then **purify it** by boiling. You can boil water by placing the filled bottle into a campfire or furnace. *“Water can be purified on a campfire or a furnace”* to improve its purity ([Thirst Was Taken - Minecraft Mod](https://modrinth.com/mod/thirst-was-taken#:~:text=Water%20can%20be%20purified%20on,Dirty%20to%20Acceptable%2C%20for%20instance)). Two rounds of boiling might be needed for the safest water. Always keep an eye on your thirst meter and carry some water when exploring. Dehydration will set in if you neglect this (you’ll suffer slowness and eventual damage). Also note that hot climates make you thirsty faster, whereas being in a cool shaded area conserves water ([Thirst Was Taken - Minecraft Mod](https://modrinth.com/mod/thirst-was-taken#:~:text=The%20hydration%20depletion%20speed%20is,is%20present%20in%20the%20pack)) (the thirst mod integrates with the temperature system).

**5. Food and Hunting:** Food is scarcer and less nutritious than in vanilla. (If a hunger overhaul is in effect, each food item might restore fewer haunches, and you can’t spam one food without penalties.) Early on, forage for berries, mushrooms, or eggs. You might craft a **spear** or **javelin** (the pack includes Spartan Weaponry and even ancient weapons from the fossils mod) to go fishing or hunting. Spears/javelins can be thrown to damage prey from a distance – useful for hunting small dinosaurs or fish. Be cautious: attacking a prehistoric creature might provoke it. Many herbivores will flee, but some can fight back (a cornered Triceratops is no joke). Carnivores will definitely fight back and may outrun you. **Plan your hunts carefully** – or better, set traps. If the **Trapcraft** mod or similar is included, you can dig pits or use bear traps to catch unwary beasts ([Man vs Wild (Walking among the dinosaurs) - Minecraft Modpacks - CurseForge](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/modpacks/man-vs-wild-walking-among-the-dinosaurs#:~:text=,Trapcraft%29%3A%20Outsmart%20your%20foes)). Cook meat on the campfire for better hunger restoration. Remember, raw meat might cause food poisoning in this realistic setting.

**6. Health and Healing:** Combat is much more dangerous now because of the First Aid mod’s locational damage. Always check your health UI – if any body part (especially head or body) is low (flashing red), you need to heal that part. Craft **bandages or plaster** early: typically bandages are made from wool or plant cloth and string, while plasters might use paper. Use a bandage (right-click while holding it) to slowly heal a specific injured part. Severe injuries give debuffs (if your **feet** are hurt, you’ll move slowly; if your **arms** are hurt, mining and fighting are much slower; a head injury can blur your vision ([First Aid - Minecraft Mods - CurseForge](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/first-aid#:~:text=You%20will%20die%20as%20soon,can%20be%20supressed%20by%20morphine))). There is **no natural health regeneration** in this pack (by default), or it’s greatly reduced. Healing items like bandages, medkits, or even **morphine syringes** (to suppress pain effects ([First Aid - Minecraft Mods - CurseForge](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/first-aid#:~:text=You%20will%20die%20as%20soon,can%20be%20supressed%20by%20morphine))) are lifesavers. Get in the habit of retreating to safety after fights to bandage up. Also consider crafting a **First Aid Kit** later for emergency full heals.

**7. Stamina and Exhaustion:** Notice the row of **blue feather icons** above your hunger bar? That’s the **stamina bar** (provided by the *Feathers* stamina mod). Performing actions like sprinting, jumping repeatedly, or swinging heavy weapons will deplete stamina feathers. If you wear heavy armor, your maximum stamina might be reduced (armor has weight). Manage your stamina – if you exhaust it, you’ll become sluggish and unable to perform strong attacks until you recover. Resting (standing still) or drinking certain tonics can restore stamina. **Tip:** Overheating will drain your stamina faster ([hot.js](file://file-ReCFbufoBxdnx35j6cek7b#:~:text=if%20%28units%20%3D%3D%3D%20,100.4%3B)) ([hot.js](file://file-ReCFbufoBxdnx35j6cek7b#:~:text=let%20playerName%20%3D%20player,%7D%20%7D%29%3B)). If you’re running in the heat of high noon, your body will overheat and you’ll tire out quickly. Plan travels during cooler times or stick to shade to avoid this. The modpack’s scripts even tie temperature to stamina – *for example, sprinting while your body temperature is above 38°C will automatically consume extra stamina* ([hot.js](file://file-ReCFbufoBxdnx35j6cek7b#:~:text=if%20%28units%20%3D%3D%3D%20,100.4%3B)) ([hot.js](file://file-ReCFbufoBxdnx35j6cek7b#:~:text=let%20playerName%20%3D%20player,%7D%20%7D%29%3B)). So, avoid running in full sun with heavy gear; travel smart to conserve energy.

**8. Temperature and Weather:** The world’s climate is varied and can be harsh. **Cold Sweat** (the temperature mod) adds a dynamic temperature system where many factors (biome, time of day, weather, nearby heat sources, etc.) affect you ([Cold Sweat - Minecraft Mods - CurseForge](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/cold-sweat/description#:~:text=Cold%20Sweat%20is%20a%20highly,nowhere%2C%20there%27s%20no%20second%20chance)). If you’re in a **snowy mountain at night**, you will start freezing – your screen may show frost, and you’ll take damage over time. To combat cold, do one or more of: wear warm clothing (e.g., **fur armor** made from animal pelts), stay near heat (campfires, torches, lava), or drink a warm beverage. In the modpack, you can craft **fur armor** or padded armor – for example, using wool or fur from animals (bears, mammoths, etc.) to make a coat that insulates you. On the flip side, in a **scorching desert or jungle**, you risk overheating. Cool off by staying in water for a short time, seeking shade, or wearing lighter armor. There are items like **cooling gels or ice packs** (check JEI for Cold Sweat items) that can help regulate temperature. Being wet (swimming in a river) will cool you, which is good in a desert but dangerous in the arctic. Always pay attention to the temperature gauge/HUD: if you see a snowflake or sweat drop icon, take action. *Dealing with extreme conditions is manageable with preparation, but if you get stranded without gear, there’s no second chance!* ([Cold Sweat - Minecraft Mods - CurseForge](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/cold-sweat/description#:~:text=Cold%20Sweat%20is%20a%20highly,nowhere%2C%20there%27s%20no%20second%20chance)) Meaning, always pack a way to make fire and some water when you explore far.

**9. Dealing with Dinosaurs:** As you venture out, you’ll encounter many types of prehistoric creatures. **Herbivores** (like Triceratops, Stegosaurus, Brachiosaurus) are generally passive. They won’t attack unless you attack them first (or sometimes if you get too close to a parent’s offspring). However, if provoked, they can be very dangerous. For example, a Triceratops can charge and gore you, doing heavy damage. It’s often best to observe and give large beasts a respectful distance. **Carnivores** are the real threat. Small ones like Compsognathus might nip at you in groups. Medium ones like **Dilophosaurus** might ambush you (watch out for venomous spit!). Large carnivores such as **Tyrannosaurus rex** or **Spinosaurus** are apex predators – if one spots you, you likely either hide or run if you’re unprepared. In the early game, you *cannot* fight a T. rex head-on. If you hear earth-shaking footsteps or a roar that sounds very close, it might be wise to sneak away or build pillars up high (though some dinos can still reach). **Use your environment:** duck into dense forest or climb rocks; big predators have trouble in tight spaces. You could also use distraction – throw some meat on the ground or lure the predator toward other prey. Remember, dinosaurs also interact with each other; a hungry carnivore may choose an easier meal (like a nearby herbivore) over you. Carry a **Spyglass** or use the environment to scout far ahead; knowing where the big threats are will help you navigate safely.

**10. Progression and Next Steps:** Once you’ve survived the first few days with basic shelter, water, and food, aim to upgrade your gear. Progression in this pack may follow a tech-timeline: from flint to copper/bronze (if available) to iron and beyond. Iron will allow you to craft better weapons (like a machete or sabre) and armor. **Mining**: Use your Stone Hammer to gather cobblestone and coal. Craft a furnace to cook food and smelt ores. Be aware that ore spawning might be different (some packs make ores rarer or only in certain strata). If you have mods like **Immersive Engineering or Tinkers** (just as examples), they could be gateways to more advanced tools, but the core idea is to reach iron tools to more safely harvest resources. **Enchanting & Brewing**: Standard enchanting might be available once you get diamonds for an enchantment table (if diamonds exist in this world – they likely do, as even prehistoric worlds have those minerals). Brewing stands, however, require blaze powder… and since the **Nether dimension is removed** in this pack ([Man vs Wild (Walking among the dinosaurs) - Minecraft Modpacks - CurseForge](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/modpacks/man-vs-wild-walking-among-the-dinosaurs#:~:text=,it%20smoothly%20with%20Sildur%20Shader)), you’ll need alternative methods. Check if the pack provides **blaze powder equivalents** (perhaps certain plants or fossils yield blaze powder, or alchemical recipes exist). In fact, *brewing stands themselves may have a modified recipe or be disabled* until later. The modpack notes that “certain recipes are removed” and Nether/End are gone ([Man vs Wild (Walking among the dinosaurs) - Minecraft Modpacks - CurseForge](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/modpacks/man-vs-wild-walking-among-the-dinosaurs#:~:text=,it%20smoothly%20with%20Sildur%20Shader)), so likely **potions are an end-game luxury** if at all attainable. Instead, rely on herbal items from mods (for example, **tonics or elixirs from plants** that can heal or boost you, or the First Aid’s morphine for pain).

Keep track of **Advancements** as you progress. The pack includes a custom advancement tree (or uses an expanded one) to guide you. You might see advancements for milestones like crafting your first flint tool, purifying water, slaying a predator, etc. Use these as goals to learn the pack’s content. (See the **Advancements** section below for more details.)

Surviving in *Walking Among The Dinosaur* requires patience and adaptability. Each day survived is an achievement. As you get better equipment and perhaps even **befriend some dinosaurs** (yes, you may eventually tame or raise some species from eggs!), the tides slowly turn. But even in late game, a careless moment – like wandering unprotected into a frozen night or challenging a T. rex without a plan – can end in disaster. **Play smart, use your knowledge of the mechanics, and you will thrive in this primeval world.** Good luck, survivor!

## Crafting & Mechanics  

This modpack significantly alters crafting and game mechanics to create a more realistic progression. Below is a summary of important crafting changes, new recipes, and removed vanilla features you should be aware of:

- **No Punching Trees – Flint Tool Progression:** In the early game you **cannot obtain wood by hand**. Punching logs or stones yields nothing (they’re effectively invulnerable without proper tools) ([No Tree Punching - Minecraft Mods - CurseForge](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/no-tree-punching#:~:text=,and%20build%20a%20crafting%20table)). Instead, you must craft flint tools as described above. Key new recipes introduced (via the Hard Rock Tools / “No Tree Punching” style mechanics) include:  
  - **Flint Shards:** Obtained by knapping flint on a hard surface. Hold a flint and right-click on stone to break it into shards ([No Tree Punching - Minecraft Mods - CurseForge](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/no-tree-punching#:~:text=,and%20build%20a%20crafting%20table)).  
  - **Flint Knife:** Craft with 1 flint shard + 1 stick (shapeless). Used to cut plants for fiber ([No Tree Punching - Minecraft Mods - CurseForge](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/no-tree-punching#:~:text=,and%20build%20a%20crafting%20table)).  
  - **Plant String:** 3 plant fibers (from grass) in a line. Functions as early string.  
  - **Flint Hatchet (Axe):** 1 flint shard + 1 plant string + 1 stick ([No Tree Punching - RLCraft Wiki](https://rlcraft.fandom.com/wiki/No_Tree_Punching#:~:text=a%20method%20of%20gaining%20wood,Plant%20String%20and%201x%20Stick)). This replaces the wooden axe; use it to chop trees and get logs.  
  - **Flint Pickaxe:** *Removed.* (You must jump to a Stone-level tool next; see Stone Hammer.)  
  - **Stone Hammer:** 2 rocks (or cobblestone) + 1 stick (shapeless or a specific pattern). This tool acts as your first pickaxe, able to mine stone and ores but at slow speed ([HardRock Tools & Materials - Minecraft Mods - CurseForge](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/hardrock-tools-materials#:~:text=It%20was%20unrealistic%20for%20me,vanilla%20wooden%20and%20stone%20tools)). It has limited uses. Use it to gather enough iron/copper to then make real metal tools.  

  These changes mean **wooden pickaxes or wooden swords are uncraftable** – the recipes are removed or yield nothing ([HardRock Tools & Materials - Minecraft Mods - CurseForge](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/hardrock-tools-materials#:~:text=It%20was%20unrealistic%20for%20me,vanilla%20wooden%20and%20stone%20tools)). You must follow the more realistic tool progression. The game essentially *“blocks some vanilla wooden and stone tools”* forcing you to use flint hatchet and stone hammer instead ([HardRock Tools & Materials - Minecraft Mods - CurseForge](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/hardrock-tools-materials#:~:text=It%20was%20unrealistic%20for%20me,vanilla%20wooden%20and%20stone%20tools)). 

- **Removed/Modified Vanilla Recipes:** Aside from wooden tools, a number of vanilla recipes have been disabled or altered to fit the primitive survival theme and the lack of Nether/End dimensions. Notable changes:  
  - **Torch Crafting:** If the Realistic Torches feature is enabled, crafting a torch might give an **unlit torch**. You then must ignite it with a matchbox or open flame. Keep this in mind when planning light sources.  
  - **Bed Recipe:** The recipe for a bed *might* be unchanged, but consider that sleeping mechanics are different (see **Sleeping Overhaul** below). It’s possible a sleeping bag or camp roll is used instead of a vanilla bed. Check JEI for a “straw bed” or similar if regular beds aren’t craftable.  
  - **Furnace:** The furnace recipe is likely still the same (8 cobblestone), as it’s essential for progression. However, **campfires** serve as an early cooking method, so you might delay furnace until you have a base.  
  - **Brewing Stand:** With no Nether, the **Brewing Stand** recipe has been changed or disabled. In vanilla, it requires a Blaze Rod – unobtainable normally here. The modpack might allow crafting a brewing stand using a bone or exotic item, but more likely it blocks brewing until you find one in a chest or get blaze powder through alternative means. Potions are therefore very scarce.  
  - **Nether Portal & End Portal:** As per design, **Nether and End dimensions are removed** ([Man vs Wild (Walking among the dinosaurs) - Minecraft Modpacks - CurseForge](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/modpacks/man-vs-wild-walking-among-the-dinosaurs#:~:text=,it%20smoothly%20with%20Sildur%20Shader)). You cannot craft or ignite a Nether portal (obsidian might still exist but serves other uses or just builds). Eyes of Ender and End Portal Frames are irrelevant (and possibly not obtainable at all). Certain items normally from those dimensions have alternative sources: e.g., **Nether Quartz** spawns as an overworld ore or can be crafted by combining other materials ([Man vs Wild (Walking among the dinosaurs) - Minecraft Modpacks - CurseForge](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/modpacks/man-vs-wild-walking-among-the-dinosaurs#:~:text=,it%20smoothly%20with%20Sildur%20Shader)). Blaze rods/powder might be obtainable via fossil excavation (perhaps ground up from certain “fiery” fossils) or via villager-like trades with an archaeologist (if any NPC exists). Check the documentation or JEI for any custom recipe involving blaze powder or ender pearls – often modpacks add a recipe to get these using materials from fossils or other mods.  

- **New Items & Crafting Mechanics:**  
  - **Primitive Fire-starting:** You may craft a **Fire Plough** or **Hand Drill** (two sticks combined) to create fire before you have flint & steel. For example, combining two sticks in crafting could yield a *“twisted stick”* that you can use on logs to start a fire (with some chance of success). If included, use that to light campfires or torches early on.  
  - **Drying Rack / Curing Leather:** Some survival mods include a drying rack for turning hides to leather or meat to jerky. Check if you can craft a **Drying Rack** (three sticks horizontally), which lets you hang raw leather or food. This would replace smelting rotten flesh into leather (which might be disabled). Instead, kill wild animals for hides and dry them to get leather over time.  
  - **Tanning and Armor:** With the inclusion of temperature mechanics, **fur armor and wool clothing** are lifesavers in cold biomes. Craft **Fur Armor** using pelts from animals. For example, 8 bear pelts could make a Fur Chestplate, which provides warmth. Similarly, **lined armor** (like armor with wool padding) might be craftable by combining a piece of armor with wool in a crafting grid to add insulation. On the flip side, **summer gear** like a straw hat or cooling vest could exist for hot climates (perhaps crafted from reeds or special gels). Always consult JEI (Just Enough Items) to see these custom recipes. They often appear in the “Equipment” or “Armor” category.  
  - **Advanced Weapons:** The modpack features **Spartan Weaponry** and possibly ancient weapons from the Fossils mod. This means you can craft a variety of weapons beyond the vanilla sword: knives, spears, **javelins**, warhammers, bows, crossbows, even slings. For instance, a **spear** might be crafted with a flint shard (or iron ingot later) on a long stick (maybe 2 sticks in line). **Javelins** can often be crafted similarly to arrows but yield throwable spears. The Fossils & Archaeology mod itself provides an **Ancient Javelin** (found via archeology) and unique weapons like an **Ancient Sword** – these might not be craftable but discovered. Experiment with Spartan Weaponry recipes (they typically follow a pattern: a sword = handle + material + material; a halberd = axe head + spear, etc., and JEI will list them). These weapons give you flexibility in combat style. For example, a **knife** is very fast and good for quick hits (or even throwing) but low damage, whereas a **pike** has long reach to hit dinosaurs from a safer distance. Shields from Spartan Shields can also be crafted using wood/leather or iron – very useful against charging dinos or projectiles.  
  - **First Aid Supplies:** New recipes exist for medical items: **Bandage** (maybe 1 wool + 1 string ([Locational Damage | RLCraft Wiki - Fandom](https://rlcraft.fandom.com/wiki/Locational_Damage#:~:text=Locational%20Damage%20,First%20Aid%20menu%2C%20a%20mini))), **Plaster** (1 paper + 1 string), **Splint** (sticks + string for broken legs), **Morphine Syringe** (requires some brewing or rare drops). Craft a few bandages as soon as you have wool or cotton. Later, if you find morphine (maybe crafted from poppies and bottles), it can temporarily nullify limb debuffs (use sparingly). Also look for **Herbal Remedies** – some mods add herbal poultices or brews (perhaps via Farmer’s Delight or simple tea brewing) that can heal you or warm you up.  
  - **Fossil Revival Machinery:** A core aspect of the pack is interacting with fossils and potentially bringing dinos to life yourself. The **Fossils and Archeology Revival mod** adds a suite of machines: the **Analyzer**, **Culture Vat**, **Sifter**, and more. You’ll need to craft an **Analyzer** first (usually 4 iron, 4 fossil pieces, 1 relic scrap – check JEI). This machine lets you analyze the bio-fossils and other paleontological finds you dig up. Through analysis, you obtain DNA of ancient creatures. Next, the **Culture Vat** (glass, iron, slime, and a bio-fossil maybe) is used to grow embryos or eggs from DNA using fuel like milk or nutrient broth. These are mid-game goals: start collecting fossils early by mining fossil ore (which spawns in underground fossil deposits). The pack’s fishing loot even yields some fossils and ancient meat ([script.js](file://file-F8uXDdwejVywke4xbTywj6#:~:text=%29%3B%20pool.addWeightedLoot%28%5B%20Item.of%28,withChance%282%29)) ([script.js](file://file-F8uXDdwejVywke4xbTywj6#:~:text=pool.anyBiome%28,withChance%282)), hinting that paleontology is a big part of progression. Once you have an Analyzer and Culture Vat set up in a secure base, you can create your own baby dinosaurs! Be careful with this power – failing cultures can result in hostile *failuresaurus* creatures, and raising a carnivore from birth still requires safety measures. (Pro tip: craft a **Dinopedia** book using a DNA + book to monitor your pets.)  
  - **Custom Brewing or Cooking:** Because standard brewing is limited, the pack might lean on **campfire cooking and brewing via cauldrons**. For example, you may be able to brew **herbal tinctures** by tossing specific ingredients into a boiling cauldron over a fire (this would be indicated in quest or advancement hints if so). **Brewing Stand Changes:** If brewing stands are obtainable, the recipe might require an *alternative blaze rod*. Some modpacks use **Bone Blocks + magma cream** to simulate a “blaze rod” or require a special item from a boss. It’s worth checking the crafting book or JEI for a brewing stand recipe. It could be disabled entirely to keep potions out until very late.  
  - **Sleeping & Time Progression:** The pack includes *Sleeping Overhaul* mechanics ([Man vs Wild (Walking among the dinosaurs) - Minecraft Modpacks - CurseForge](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/modpacks/man-vs-wild-walking-among-the-dinosaurs#:~:text=,Essential%20for%20your%20safety)). This likely means you can’t skip the night as easily or without consequences. Perhaps sleeping doesn’t reset your spawn or doesn’t fast-forward time normally. There might be a **sleepiness meter** or requirement to sleep a certain number of hours. Be prepared that setting a bed at night might not simply make it daytime – it could just accelerate time a bit or could even cause grogginess on waking. If **Somnia** or **Tough As Nails** sleep tuning is present, partial sleep might regenerate some health or stamina but not skip dawn. Always ensure you are safe when you sleep (in an enclosed space) since nights are dangerous to sit through if you can’t skip them fully.

- **World Generation & Resources:** The world gen in this pack is enhanced by mods like **Terralith** (which adds spectacular terrain and biomes) and possibly **Biomes O’ Plenty** or others. Expect to see realistic biomes that could affect resource gathering. For example, flint might be more common in certain gravelly biomes, certain plants for medicine grow only in specific biomes, etc. **No Villages/Structures:** As noted, normal villages and structures are turned off ([Man vs Wild (Walking among the dinosaurs) - Minecraft Modpacks - CurseForge](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/modpacks/man-vs-wild-walking-among-the-dinosaurs#:~:text=,it%20smoothly%20with%20Sildur%20Shader)). This means **no easy loot chests** from blacksmiths or temples. You’ll rely on digging up **fossil structures** or custom ruins (if any) for treasure. The Fossils mod does add structures like **ancient temples** (beware of traps and the Anu boss if that’s enabled) and **fossil deposits** with bones in desert biomes. Treasure chests you do find might have scarab gems or ancient figurines rather than the usual diamonds and gold. Embrace exploration – finding a pile of fossils or an abandoned encampment can jump-start your progress with valuable items.

- **Advancement-Linked Mechanics:** Some recipes or items might be locked behind advancements. This pack doesn’t have a traditional quest book, but it might use **advancements as guidance**. It’s possible that certain complex recipes only unlock or become visible after you achieve a relevant advancement (e.g., after you “Discover Fire” by lighting your first campfire, you *might* unlock the ability to craft charcoal or torches). Keep an eye on advancement pop-ups and check the Advancements screen often to see if new branches opened – they could hint at new craftables or goals.

Overall, **crafting in Walking Among The Dinosaur requires experimentation and paying attention to in-game documentation**. Use **JEI (Just Enough Items)** to your advantage: search for “(No Recipe)” or items you think you should make to see if there’s a custom recipe. Many of the modded systems (flint tools, fossil revival, etc.) have in-game books or tooltips as well. For instance, the **“Strange Journal”** you might find when you spawn (or craft from a book and relic scrap) could provide lore and recipes. Always read the mod tutorial books (many mods like First Aid or Cold Sweat provide a manual accessible via the “?” button or an item).

By mastering flint knapping, primitive crafting, and utilizing new items like **plant rope, fur armor, and ancient gadgets**, you’ll gradually move from surviving to thriving. The feeling of crafting your first iron weapon or successfully incubating a dinosaur egg using these systems is incredibly rewarding. Adapt and overcome!

## Advancements  

Advancements (Minecraft’s achievement system) in this modpack serve as a loose guide and a chronicle of your journey. While *Walking Among The Dinosaur* does not have a conventional quest book, it likely features **custom advancements** and progression milestones that will help you track your objectives and celebrate important feats. Here we’ll outline some advancement categories and give hints on how to unlock them:

- **Survival Beginnings:** Early game advancements will encourage you to master basic survival tasks. For example, upon crafting your first flint tool you might get an advancement (e.g., *“Knap Time”* for making a flint knife). Expect an advancement for obtaining your first logs without punching trees (perhaps titled *“The First Axe”* or *“No Tree Punching”*). Similarly, purifying water for the first time or cooking your first meal on a campfire could grant an advancement. These early challenges ensure you learn the new mechanics.  
  *Tips:* Follow the hints in advancement titles/descriptions. If one says “Thirsty?” it probably wants you to drink purified water. Use JEI to figure out how to get the required item. Early advancements often unlock one after the other in a chain (flint -> fire -> water -> shelter).

- **Prehistoric Explorer:** As you venture out, advancements will reward exploration and discovery. For instance, *“Into the Wild”* might trigger when you enter a new custom biome or survive a night outside. *“Encounter of the Jurassic Kind”* might be given when you first spot a dinosaur or get within a certain range of a T. rex. There may be advancements for discovering specific notable creatures: *“Clever Girl”* after encountering (or escaping) a pack of raptors, or *“Gentle Giant”* after observing a huge herbivore like Brachiosaurus without getting harmed. Another might be *“Oceanic Terror”* if you dive into the ocean and meet something like a Mosasaurus (careful with that!). These encourage you to explore every environment.  
  *Tips:* If you notice an advancement hint in the menu like “Beware the Swamps” or “Something lurks in the deep…”, these are clues that a unique creature or structure exists in that area. Prepare accordingly (e.g., swamps might have sarcosuchus or other dangers, so an advancement might trigger upon surviving or killing one).

- **Hunter and Hunted:** Combat-related advancements will track your growing prowess. Expect ones for **slaying your first dinosaur**. For example, *“First Blood”* could be for killing a small creature (like a Compy or Dilophosaur). *“Dominion”* could be for taking down a large predator like an Allosaurus. The ultimate one might be for defeating the king of them all – *“Tyrant Tamer”* for killing or taming a Tyrannosaurus rex. There could also be advancements for **not dying** in tough situations: e.g., *“Against All Odds”* if you survive an attack with under one heart due to First Aid’s systems, or *“Resilience”* after fully recovering from a critical injury (head or body red-lined and healed).  
  *Tips:* Engage with the hunting gameplay. Set traps or use ranged weapons – often advancements for big kills don’t require you to melee, so be smart. Some advancements might require using a specific weapon (maybe *“Bullseye”* for hitting a target with a javelin from long distance, or *“One Shot, One Kill”* if crossbows are present).

- **Technology & Crafting Milestones:** As you progress technologically, you’ll unlock advancements for key crafting achievements. For example, *“Forging Ahead”* when you smelt your first iron ingot and craft an iron tool. *“Home Sweet Home”* might be awarded when you build a permanent shelter with a bed and storage. The fossil revival chain will certainly have multiple advancements: 
  - *“Curious Curator”* for crafting an Analyzer. 
  - *“DNA Discoverer”* when you successfully retrieve DNA from a fossil in the Analyzer. 
  - *“Life Finds a Way”* (a cheeky Jurassic Park reference perhaps) for successfully culturing and hatching your first prehistoric creature egg ([Therizinosaurus | Fossils and Archeology Mod Revival Wiki | Fandom](https://fossils-archeology.fandom.com/wiki/Therizinosaurus#:~:text=prehistoric%20creature%20with%20a%20small,of%20it%20being%20a%20therizinosaurus)). 
  - *“It’s a Living!”* for feeding or taming a dino. 
  - *“Don’t Move a Muscle…”* possibly when you first use a Scarab Gem to tame a hostile ancient creature (the Fossils mod allows using a rare scarab gem to pacify a dino instantly). 
  Additionally, advancements may guide you to create supporting tech: *“Paleontologist”* for using a Sifter to get fossils, *“Jurassic Farm”* if you breed two dinosaurs together, etc.  

  Outside of fossils, other mods might have their own advancement trees (check the Advancements screen – mods like Spartan Weaponry or First Aid may add entries). For instance, Spartan Weaponry might reward you for crafting one of each weapon type (*“Master at Arms”* for crafting a spear, dagger, longsword, etc., all at least once). Cold Sweat might have one for experiencing an extreme temperature (*“Thermoregulator”* for surviving a hyperthermia or hypothermia event).

- **Explorer’s Lore:** If the modpack has hidden lore bits, some advancements could be tied to finding special locations or items. For example, *“Ancient Archives”* if you find a secret journal or stone tablet detailing the backstory. Or *“Temple of Anu”* for discovering the hidden fossil temple (if present) and *“Vanquish the Ancient King”* for defeating its boss. These are more optional/endgame, but they add depth.  
  *Tips:* Keep an eye out for strange structures or items like notes. They might not only tell story but also trigger an advancement acknowledging you found them.

- **Endgame and Challenges:** Since there’s no traditional “Ender Dragon” ending (no End dimension), the endgame advancements revolve around mastering this world. Some possibilities: 
  - *“Balance Restored”* – perhaps if you manage to populate the world with a pair of every tameable dinosaur (a play on collecting them all). 
  - *“Prehistoric Protector”* – if you go a certain number of days without dying or without any hostile mob kills (living peacefully). 
  - *“Apex Predator”* – after slaying one of each major predator. 
  - *“Iron Will, Stone Age”* – a funny challenge advancement if you somehow survive X days using only flint/stone tools without ever using iron (a self-imposed challenge). 
  - *“Modern Man”* – conversely, if you automate or reach a tech mod’s pinnacle (if any minor tech like simple machinery is included).
  
  Check if the pack includes **BlazeandCave’s Advancements Pack or a similar datapack**. Those add hundreds of advancements including mod interactions. For example, BlazeandCave might have a section for “Fossils and Archaeology” with specific tasks for that mod, a section for survivalism (thirst, temperature achievements), etc. If that pack is included, you’ll have a very full Advancements tab with tiers (Stone Age, Bronze Age, Iron Age, etc.) which can be very fun to complete. Each advancement will tell you its requirement when hovered. They can range from mundane (sleep in a bed) to humorous (get killed by certain obscure thing intentionally).

**How to Use Advancements:** Open your Advancements menu in-game (`L` key by default or via the pause menu). You’ll see several tabs, one for each theme or mod. Look through them periodically. They not only track what you’ve done but often hint at what you *could* do next. If you see an advancement with a question mark icon, it means the criteria hasn’t been discovered yet (but you might see its parent advancement). For instance, you have “Obtain Dino DNA” done, and a hidden one after it that might reveal once you have DNA – likely “Create a Dinosaur”. This tells you that yes, you can indeed create one, and you should figure out how (hint: Culture Vat).

Also, advancements can provide **emotional narrative moments**. For example, when you hatch your first dino, the advancement text might say “Who’s a cute little baby?” – making it a memorable event. They serve as both goals and story beats.

In summary, keep an eye on advancements as a guiding hand. They’ll ensure you experience all major aspects of the modpack. If you manage to complete most or all of them, congratulations – you’ve essentially “won” the prehistoric survival challenge and seen everything from the humble beginnings to mastering life among dinosaurs.

*(If a complete list of advancements is desired, you can find it in the datapacks folder or modpack documentation. The above covers the spirit of them without listing every single one, leaving some surprises for you to discover!)*

## Lore & Worldbuilding  

*You awaken disoriented on a bed of ferns, the dawn light filtering through colossal tree ferns and cycads. In the distance, a primordial jungle stretches out before you, filled with unfamiliar sounds – the haunting cry of a pterosaur riding the morning thermals and the distant bellow of a giant sauropod.* 

There are **no signs of civilization** – no roads, no villages, not even a broken Nether portal. This world is **untouched by human hands**, a canvas of raw nature and ancient life. It’s as if you’ve fallen through time or into an alternate Earth where humans never became the dominant species. The **only footprints on the soil are those of reptiles with thunderous steps**. You are truly alone in a land that does not recognize you at the top of the food chain.

As the reality sinks in, **emotion washes over you**. First, awe: towering above the treetops, you catch a glimpse of a **Brachiosaurus** moving with slow grace, its long neck silhouetted against the sunrise. You feel a childlike wonder seeing a living giant you only knew from textbooks. But that wonder is quickly tempered by a stab of fear when you hear a low growl behind you – in the shadows, two golden eyes watch your every move. A **raptor** – curious, or sizing you up for breakfast? Your heart pounds. Here, *you* are the odd creature out, possibly prey. 

**Why are you here?** Perhaps you were a scientist, testing a prototype time-travel device or cryogenic chamber that malfunctioned. Maybe you washed ashore from a metaphysical storm that tore you from your world. Or maybe this **is** your world – but an ancient curse or scientific experiment caused the realm to regress to a Mesozoic era. The modpack intentionally leaves this mystery open, allowing you to craft your own backstory. Scattered across the land you might find **hints of lore**: an **abandoned journal** in a ruined camp that speaks of others who came before, or cave paintings depicting humans and dinosaurs coexisting. These clues tug at the central question: *are you the first, or just the latest, to walk among these dinosaurs?*

One thing is certain: **you must adapt**. The first nights are the hardest. Imagine huddling in a cave as darkness falls, the sounds of the jungle amplifying your loneliness. You keep your campfire low, hearing the guttural snarls of something massive outside. A part of you wants to cry out from isolation and exhaustion, but you grit your teeth and persevere. In the flickering firelight, you carve simple tools from flint and bone, each scrape a defiant act of will to survive. These tools, primitive as they are, are your lifeline – a reminder that ingenuity can conquer even 65-million-year-old problems.

**Emotion and immersion** drive the lore of this world. Over time, fear gives way to respect. You learn the patterns of the creatures. The frantic terror you felt upon first hearing a T. rex roar becomes a focused determination to avoid its territory or confront it on your terms. You start to feel a kinship with the land. The **role of “lonely survivor” evolves into “resourceful pioneer.”** Perhaps you even take on a guardian role for the gentle giants nearby – saving a baby triceratops from a pack of starving dilophosaurs. In that moment, as the mother trumpets her thanks, you realize *you* have become part of this ecosystem, an unwritten chapter in its ancient story.

The environment itself tells stories. Moving through a misty swamp at dawn, you stumble upon a half-sunk stone structure. Vines strangle its crumbling pillars; inside, faded mosaics depict people venerating a great feathered serpent. Could humans have been here ages past, leaving only these silent relics? Or is it the work of some intelligent dinosaur species? The **worldbuilding is subtle yet rich** – if you pay attention, every fossil, every strange ruin, even the distribution of species by biome (finding ancient Permian creatures in one region and Cretaceous in another) all weave together a narrative of Earth’s eons and perhaps a guiding hand behind this “park” of time.

Your own actions contribute to the lore. When you successfully hatch a dinosaur from a DNA sample, you essentially bridge an eon – it’s a profound moment, giving life to something extinct. Do you do this out of scientific responsibility, curiosity, or the hope of companionship in this lonely world? The modpack’s narrative adapts to your perspective. Some players may become benevolent naturalists – **curating a sanctuary** where herbivores thrive and dangerous predators are kept at bay with barriers. Others might become hunters, seeking to dominate and **challenge the apex predators**, proving that mankind (even alone) can claim the throne as the most fearsome creature. The lore supports both paths: will you be a **caretaker of this Jurassic realm or its fiercest conqueror**?

Throughout your journey, emotions run high: the **sheer terror** of fleeing through dense underbrush with a raptor on your heels; the **triumphant exhilaration** of standing atop a fallen predator, bruised but victorious; the **melancholy** of watching a peaceful dinosaur succumb to injury or starvation in the harsh cycles of nature, reminding you that this world, for all its beauty, is unforgiving. The modpack’s worldbuilding aims to make you *feel* these moments, not just play them.

In the end, *Walking Among The Dinosaur* invites you to tell **your story** of survival. Perhaps you’ll discover a way back to modern times – maybe a series of late-game advancements leads to building a portal or signaling a rescue (that part is for you to find out). Or maybe, when all is said and done, you **choose to stay**. After overcoming every trial, you stand in the golden twilight on a high cliff, looking over a valley where dinosaurs roam free, a valley that **you helped shape** – and you feel not like an outsider, but at home. In this moment, the title’s meaning truly sinks in: *Walking Among The Dinosaur* is not just physically doing so, but living among them as one of them, part of the tapestry of this ancient world.

*(The lore is intentionally open-ended and emergent. Pay attention to in-game notes, environmental storytelling, and let your imagination fill in the blanks. The emotional journey from fear to mastery is the core narrative – your personal growth is the storyline that connects everything in this prehistoric saga.)*

## Bug Reports & Contributions  

Even in a carefully curated modpack, you may encounter bugs or issues. **Walking Among The Dinosaur** welcomes community feedback to improve the experience. Here’s how you can report problems and even contribute to the project’s development:

**Reporting Bugs:**  
If you find a bug (for example, a crafting recipe that doesn’t work, a dinosaur that behaves oddly, a mod conflict causing crashes, etc.), please report it through the modpack’s GitHub issue tracker. The developers actively monitor GitHub for issues.

- **Step 1: Locate the GitHub Repository:** The modpack’s official GitHub can be found via the project page (look for a “Source” or “Issues” link on Modrinth or CurseForge, or use the link provided in the README if available). Navigate to the repository, and click on the “Issues” tab.  
- **Step 2: Search Existing Issues:** Someone else might have already reported your bug. Use the search bar to see if your issue is mentioned (e.g., search “crash” or the name of the mod causing trouble). If you find a matching report, you can add any additional details you have as a comment rather than opening a new one.  
- **Step 3: Open a New Issue:** If it’s a new bug, click “New Issue”. Provide a clear title and description. Include the following details:
  - **Modpack Version:** Specify which version of the modpack you are using (e.g., v1.0.3 Beta). 
  - **Describe the Bug:** Explain what happened and what you expected to happen. Be as specific as possible (e.g., “When using the Analyzer with a Confuciusornis DNA, the game crashes to desktop”). 
  - **Steps to Reproduce:** List the steps leading up to the bug so the devs can recreate it. For example:
    1. Place DNA into Analyzer.
    2. Wait for process to complete.
    3. Crash occurs at 100% progress.
  - **Crash Reports/Logs:** If the game crashed or threw errors, attach the `latest.log` or crash report file (you can drag-and-drop it into the GitHub issue text field). This is extremely helpful ([9.1.1.0 for Forge 1.18.2 - Fossils and Archeology: Revival](https://modrinth.com/mod/fossils-and-archeology-revival/version/1.18.2-9.1.1.0-forge#:~:text=,and%20not%20dropping%20when%20destroyed)) ([9.1.1.0 for Forge 1.18.2 - Fossils and Archeology: Revival](https://modrinth.com/mod/fossils-and-archeology-revival/version/1.18.2-9.1.1.0-forge#:~:text=,Tempskya%20top%20and%20leaf%20drops)) (for example, a log might show which mod caused the exception). 
  - **Screenshots:** If applicable, include a screenshot (for GUI bugs, visual glitches, etc.). On GitHub you can paste images directly into the issue. Ensure no sensitive info is in the screenshot. 
  - **Additional Context:** Mention any other details – were you on singleplayer or a server? Did you add any mods or change configs from the default pack? The more info, the easier it is to diagnose.  
- **Step 4: Submit and Monitor:** Submit the issue. A developer or community member might follow up with questions – GitHub will notify you if so. Provide any answers or test builds promptly. Once the issue is fixed in an update, the devs will typically close the issue with a note.

**Contributing to the Project:**  
This modpack is a community effort, and contributions are welcome! If you have ideas for improvements or want to help with development (like tweaking configs, adding quests/advancements, etc.), here are ways to contribute:

- **Suggestions and Feedback:** If you have balance suggestions or feature requests (for example, “the desert feels empty, maybe add X mod” or “thirst drains a bit too fast”), you can open an issue on GitHub tagged as “Suggestion” or discuss it in the project’s Discord (if available). Thoughtful feedback is appreciated. The maintainers might not implement every suggestion, but they do consider player experience seriously. If you love the pack, leaving an endorsement or positive review on Modrinth/CurseForge also helps it gain traction.

- **Contribute via GitHub (for tech-savvy):** The modpack’s configuration (datapacks, KubeJS scripts, etc.) might be stored in the GitHub repo. If you are comfortable with Git and have a fix:
  - Fork the repository on GitHub to your account.
  - Clone it and make your changes. For example, if you found that a recipe is too harsh, you could adjust the KubeJS script or data .json file responsible.
  - Test your changes locally with the modpack to ensure your fix works and doesn’t break anything else.
  - Commit your changes with clear messages and push them to your fork.
  - Open a **Pull Request** on the original repo, describing what your change does and why it should be merged.
  
  Ensure your changes adhere to the project’s style. For example, if adding a new advancement or script, follow the format of existing ones. It’s also wise to discuss major changes in an issue first before spending effort on a PR, to see if the maintainers are receptive.

- **Translating or Documenting:** If you’re not a coder, you might contribute by writing documentation or translating the pack to another language. For instance, providing a **translated README or wiki** in your language, or translating in-game custom texts (advancement descriptions, etc.) if the pack supports localization. You can submit these via GitHub or contact the devs.

- **Testing and QA:** Another valuable way to contribute is by testing new versions. If the maintainers announce a beta or release candidate (perhaps in Discord or tagged pre-release on GitHub), you can try it and report any new bugs or issues *before* it goes public. This helps ensure stable releases.

**Community Conduct:**  
When reporting bugs or interacting with the project team, remember to be civil and patient. We’re all passionate about making the modpack great. If something frustrates you in-game, take a breath before writing an angry post. Constructive criticism will get things fixed much faster than rants. The authors have spent countless hours integrating mods and might even be dealing with limitations beyond their control (some issues might be from mods themselves). They appreciate polite, detailed reports.

**Where to get help:**  
For general help or gameplay questions (not necessarily bugs), consider joining the community Discord (if provided) or posting on the discussion tab on CurseForge. Other players or the devs can give tips if you’re stuck (for example, if you can’t figure out a recipe or advancement, someone might gently nudge you in the right direction without spoiling too much). Just be sure to use spoiler tags or channels if discussing late-game content, so new players can discover the surprises on their own.

Finally, **thank you for contributing**! Whether you’re reporting a bug or suggesting a tweak, you’re helping to improve *Walking Among The Dinosaur* for everyone. The project thrives on community input, and even a small fix (like correcting a recipe or grammar in an advancement text) can enhance the polish of the modpack. Together, the community and developers ensure that this prehistoric adventure remains as smooth and enjoyable as possible, even as new updates and content are added.

Happy surviving, and we look forward to your feedback in the GitHub tracker or community forums. Now, gear up and go make history in the land time forgot!

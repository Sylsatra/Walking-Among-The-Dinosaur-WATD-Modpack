# 🦖 **Walking Among The Dinosaur Modpack (Forge 1.18.2)**  

## **🌍 Introduction**  
**Step back in time. Survive. Adapt. Walk among the dinosaurs.**  

Welcome to **Walking Among The Dinosaur (WATD)** – a prehistoric survival modpack that **thrusts you into a world untouched by civilization**. This isn't just another dinosaur modpack—this is a **hardcore survival experience** set in a land where **you** are the anomaly.  

Gone are the comforts of villages, enchanted gear, and instant survival tools. Instead, you’ll face:  

✅ **A Living Prehistoric World:** A fully **immersive ecosystem** where dinosaurs roam freely.   
✅ **Harsh Survival Mechanics:** **Hunger, thirst, body temperature, stamina, and injuries** all play a role in your survival.  
✅ **Realistic Progression:** No punching trees—start from **primitive flint tools** and work your way up like an early human.  
✅ **Dynamic Dinosaur AI:** Some creatures are peaceful, while others will **hunt you down relentlessly**.  
✅ **No Vanilla Mobs:** **There are no villages, villagers, or passive animals**—only prehistoric creatures and the dangers of nature.  
✅ **Unique Mechanics:** Overhauled **combat, movement, and crafting**—with **custom stamina, exhaustion, temperature, and advanced first-aid mechanics**.  

Whether you choose to **survive as a lone wanderer**, **tame and raise prehistoric creatures**, or **carve your own legend into the fossil record**, one thing is certain: **you are not at the top of the food chain.**  

🌿 **How long can you survive in this land before becoming history?**

# **🎮 Gameplay Overview**  

## **🌿 Getting Started - Your First Day**  
When you first spawn, you’ll notice something **very different**:  
- There are **no villages, no cows, no pigs, no zombies**—only **untamed prehistoric nature**.  
- **Punching trees? Forget it.** Your **bare hands are useless**—you must start with **flint tools**.  
- **Water is undrinkable** unless purified. You’ll need **bottles or a filtration method** to stay hydrated.  
- **Nightfall is deadly.** Without fire or shelter, the **cold will sap your strength**, and predators will hunt in the darkness.  

### **🛠️ First Steps:**
✅ **Find Gravel** → Get Flint → Knapp Flint on Stone → Craft a **Flint Knife**.  
✅ **Gather Plant Fiber** → Craft **Plant String** → Craft a **Flint Hatchet**.  
✅ **Cut Trees** → Make a **Crafting Table** → Start your **primitive survival journey**.  

📌 **Early Game Tips:**
🔥 **Fire is essential.** A **campfire** provides warmth, light, and water purification.  
🥶 **Cold can kill you.** Craft **fur armor** before venturing into snowy biomes.  
🏃 **Stamina matters.** Sprinting drains stamina—**rest frequently** or risk exhaustion.  
🥩 **Hunt carefully.** Not every creature is friendly—**some will fight back**.
